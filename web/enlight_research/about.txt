Fact and problem: Traditional bank stock research websites are boring and only available to a select few.

Solution: Enlight Research will provide high-quality research on Baltic listed stocks for free and available to ALL.

Mission: Make the website entertaining to private investors/readers. Something in between a news portal (like Delfi) and a traditional Bank research website.
This means lots of moving pictures, videos, maybe flashing stuff. It MUST be fun and entertaining! NOT boring and financial. 
CREATIVITY IS THE NAME OF THE GAME!
